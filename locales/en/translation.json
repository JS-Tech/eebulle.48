    "1": "What is it ?",
    "2": "« 48 hours of worship and prayer » is a weekend of non-stop worshipping in the church. Music bands from different horizons play during these two days to lead the assembly in a strong moment of connection with God. The goal of 48 hours of worship is to bless the region with the presence of God, because we believe that He dwells in the place where the praises of His people are offered (Ps 22:3). Such an event also leads the participants to be encouraged and edified through the Spirit of God, who acts in a powerful way when we invite Him.",
